I half cloned the figma design with topic of a new Audio Generation AI from openAI

thanks to adrianhajdin for the idea here is the link to his github:

I made this project alone, but the file management and the React dependecy I took it from him so thanks again adrianhajdin

This is my first React project, I was searching a lot on how to use the components properly and also learn a little of BEM methology, and compare to my others projects this file management and scss code are more legible in my opnion
