      <h2>Painting Caption Conditioning</h2>
      <div className='examples__music'>
        <ArticleImg img={nightVG} title={"The Starry night - Vincent van Gogh"} des={"The Starry Night (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village."} audio={nightMusic} />
        <ArticleImg img={napoleon} title={"Napoleon Crossing the Alps - Jacques-Louis David"} des={"The composition shows a strongly idealized view of the real crossing that Napoleon and his army made across the Alps through the Great St Bernard Pass in May 1800."} audio={napoleonMusic}/>
        <ArticleImg img={wanderer} title={"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog - Caspar David Friedrich"} des={"It depicts a man standing upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer; he is gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog through which other ridges, trees, and mountains pierce, which stretches out into the distance indefinitely."} audio={wandererMusic}/>

      <h2>Audio Generation From Rich Captions</h2>
      <div className='examples__generation'>
        <Audiogeneration desc={" The main soundtrack of an arcade game. It is fast-paced and upbeat, with a catchy electric guitar riff. The music is repetitive and easy to remember, but with unexpected sounds, like cymbal crashes or drum rolls."} au={firstAG}/>
        <Audiogeneration desc={" This is an r&b/hip-hop music piece. There is a male vocal rapping and a female vocal singing in a rap-like manner. The beat is comprised of a piano playing the chords of the tune with an electronic drum backing. The atmosphere of the piece is playful and energetic. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a high school drama movie/TV show. It could also be played at birthday parties or beach parties."} au={secondAG}/>
        <Audiogeneration desc={" Epic soundtrack using orchestral instruments. The piece builds tension, creates a sense of urgency. An a cappella chorus sing in unison, it creates a sense of power and strength."} au={thirdAG}/>
